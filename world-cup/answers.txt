Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

small number of simulation

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I think 10000 or more just little will be good enough
